Tetrisbot incorporates computer vision and motion planning to pick up pieces and place them in a desired final configuration using a Baxter robot from Rethink Robotics.

Running this project requires the standard suite of robotics and scientific computing libraries and software. The code we developed runs in Python2, not Python3.
